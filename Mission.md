# Text Adventures Suite #

Text Adventures Suite is a authoring and interpreter of Text Adventures largely inspired on Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone [Fighting Fantasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy) series of game books in the 80s.

You can create your text adventures with a graph of connected scenes, you can have combat, test your skill pages and even add Java [beanshell](http://www.beanshell.org) programming to add more complex rules!

Feel free to try it and if you please, gimme any kind of [feedback](mailto:tas@bpfurtado.net).
