Text Adventures Suite is a authoring and interpreter of Text Adventures largely inspired on 
Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone Fighting Fantasy series of game books in the 80s.

It has been more than a pleasure to me to create one step at a time this software. 
It\'s free and open source (GPLv2): https://github.com/ghostsysoutnull/text-adventures-suite
